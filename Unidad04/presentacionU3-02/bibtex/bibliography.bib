abstract = {Urban development is a principal driver of landscape change affecting the integrity of ecological systems and the capacity of the landscape to support species. We developed an urban growth model (SPRAWL), evaluated it with hindcasting, and used it to simulate urban growth across the northeastern United States between 2010 and 2080 under four alternative scenarios. In the model, urban growth is constrained by demand for new development for each time step at the subregional scale. Demand is subsequently allocated to local application panes (5 km on a side within 15 km window) using a unique landscape context matching algorithm, such that the more historical development that occurred in the matched training windows the higher the proportion of future demand assigned to the pane. Lastly, demand in each pane is allocated among development types and then allocated to individual patches based on suitability surfaces unique to that landscape context. SPRAWL has a multi-level, multi-scale structure that captures urban growth drivers operating at multiple scales and, when combined with the unique matching and suitability algorithms, induces non-stationarity in urban growth across time and space. Our evaluation indicated that SPRAWL was highly discriminatory, well-calibrated, and highly predictive of new development, but performed weakly for redevelopment transitions. We evaluated the ecological impacts of four alternative urban growth scenarios varying in total demand for new development and “sprawliness” of new development relative to historical patterns using an ecological integrity index. The results were consistent with expectations and demonstrated the potential of SPRAWL for scenario analysis.},

@article{feng2018,
abstract = {Cellular automata (CA) is a spatially explicit modeling tool that has been shown to be effective in simulating urban growth dynamics and in projecting future scenarios across scales. At the core of urban CA models are transition rules that define land transformation from non-urban to urban. Our objective is to compare the urban growth simulation and prediction abilities of different metaheuristics included in the R package optimx. We applied five metaheuristics in optimx to near-optimally parameterize CA transition rules and construct CA models for urban simulation. One advantage of metaheuristics is their ability to optimize complexly constrained computational problems, yielding objective parameterization with strong predictive power. From these five models, we selected conjugate gradient-based CA (CG-CA) and spectral projected gradient-based CA (SPG-CA) to simulate the 2005–2015 urban growth and to project future scenarios to 2035 with four strategies for Su-Xi-Chang Agglomeration in China. The two CA models produced about 86{\%} overall accuracy with standard Kappa coefficient above 69{\%}, indicating their good ability to capture urban growth dynamics. Four alternative scenarios out to the year 2035 were constructed considering the overall effect of all candidate influencing factors and the enhanced effects of county centers, road networks and population density. These scenarios can provide insight into future urban patterns resulting from today's urban planning and infrastructure, and can inform future development strategies for sustainable cities. Our proposed metaheuristic CA models are also applicable in modeling land-use and urban growth in other rapidly developing areas.},

@article{clarke1997,
abstract = {In this paper we describe a cellular automaton (CA) simulation model developed to predict urban growth as part of a project for estimating the regional and broader impact of urbanization on the San Francisco Bay area's climate. The rules of the model are more complex than those of a typical CA and involve the use of multiple data sources, including topography, road networks, and existing settlement distributions, and their modification over time. In addition, the control parameters of the model are allowed to self-modify: that is, the CA adapts itself to the circumstances it generates, in particular, during periods of rapid growth or stagnation. In addition, the model was written to allow the accumulation of probabilistic estimates based on Monte Carlo methods. Calibration of the model has been accomplished by the use of historical maps to compare model predictions of urbanization, based solely upon the distribution in year 1900, with observed data for years 1940, 1954, 1962, 1974, and 1990. The complexity of this model has made calibration a particularly demanding step. Lessons learned about the methods, measures, and strategies developed to calibrate the model may be of use in other environmental modeling contexts. With the calibration complete, the model is being used to generate a set of future scenarios for the San Francisco Bay area along with their probabilities based on the Monte Carlo version of the model. Animated dynamic mapping of the simulations will be used to allow visualization of the impact of future urban growth. Introduction Although a host of natural and human environmental activities, including fire, agriculture, and deforestation, have profound impacts upon global systems, the most striking human-induced land transformation of the current era is that of urbanization. Urbanization from a global environmental context is the conversion of natural to artificial land cover characterized by human settlements and workplaces. This single transformation involves a wholesale modification of natural processes such as runoff and evapotranspiration, and the short-term and long-term impacts touch every member of the human race every day. In the short term, several decades, few of us in Europe or North America can fail to be startled when a visit back to the former fields and woodlands of our childhood playgrounds reveals only newly built-up urban land. In a longer timescale, 200 years, total global population has increased six times and the earth's urban population has i ncreased over 100 times (Hauser et al, 1982). Driven by the Industrial Revolution, cities have gone from being a minor feature on our planet to a major one. The impact of urban land on economic and environmental systems is immense compared with its spatial extent although it can be difficult to grasp the notion that incremental growth at a regional level, the summation of myriads of individual human decisions, can amount to a significant global process. Substantial growth in cities first occurred in Western Europe, America, and Japan but has spread in the latter part of this century throughout Asia, South America, and Africa.},

abstract = {This study evaluates land use/cover changes and urban expansion in Greater Dhaka, Bangladesh, between 1975 and 2003 using satellite images and socio-economic data. Spatial and temporal dynamics of land use/cover changes were quantified using three Landsat images, a supervised classification algorithm and the post-classification change detection technique in GIS. Accuracy of the Landsat-derived land use/cover maps ranged from 85 to 90{\%}. The analysis revealed that substantial growth of built-up areas in Greater Dhaka over the study period resulted significant decrease in the area of water bodies, cultivated land, vegetation and wetlands. Urban land expansion has been largely driven by elevation, population growth and economic development. Rapid urban expansion through infilling of low-lying areas and clearing of vegetation resulted in a wide range of environmental impacts, including habitat quality. As reliable and current data are lacking for Bangladesh, the land use maps produced in this study will contribute to both the development of sustainable urban land use planning decisions and also for forecasting possible future changes in growth patterns. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{dushku2003,
abstract = {Presently, the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol does not allow for crediting of projects that offset carbon dioxide emissions by preventing emissions elsewhere through averted changes in land use (or forestry). Part of the criticism of these types of projects was that projections of “without-project” baselines lacked the scientific integrity and accuracy on which to base crediting. Since 1999, Winrock International has been evaluating peer-reviewed methods for the modeling of baselines in six regions in Latin America. The model that achieved the highest overall ranking of those tested is called GEOMOD. GEOMOD strengths lie in its ease of use, its transparency, its replicability and its internal validation capability, which provides quantitative measures of the goodness of fit of modeled landscapes. It is a spatial model that employs geographic information system (GIS) technology to analyze biophysical and socio- cultural factors to map the potential for land-use changes to occur. Modeling baselines in land-use change is important for consideration when planning not only conservation projects but also afforestation and reforestation projects.},

@article{pontius2001,
abstract = {The objective of this paper is to simulate the location of land-use change, specifically forest disturbance, in Costa Rica over several decades. This paper presents a GIS-based model, GEOMOD2, which quantifies factors associated with land-use, and simulates the spatial pattern of land-use forward and backward in time. GEOMOD2 reads rasterized maps of land-use and other biogeophysical attributes to determine empirically the attributes of land that humans tend to use. Then GEOMOD2 uses the patterns of those biogeophysical attributes to simulate the spatial pattern of land-use change. GEOMOD2 can select locations for land-use change according to any of three decision rules based on (1) nearest neighbors, (2) stratification by political sub-region, and/or (3) the pattern of biogeophysical attributes. GEOMOD2 simulates the progressive loss of closed-canopy forest in Costa Rica for 1940, 1961 and 1983, which are the years for which maps of land-use are available. Also, GEOMOD2 extrapolates the pattern of land-use to the year 2010. When GEOMOD2 extrapolates land-use change over several decades, it is able to classify correctly between 74 and 88{\%} of the grid cells, for two categories: forest versus non-forest. Over various simulation runs, Kappa ranges from 0.31 to 0.53. The model's ability to predict the location of disturbance is best when the model is driven by the location of biogeophysical characteristics, most importantly lifezones. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

The local model function describes the baseline, amplitude, position of maximum/minimum and kurtosis. Merit function includes measure of data points' uncertainty based on cloud mask. This is also used to promote upward tendency of curve – merit function modeled twice: first time, low points flagged and their uncertainty doubled, then run merit function again. Local functions used to computer left minimum (spring), center max (summer) and right minimum (fall), then tied together using global model function. Also some QAQC pre-processing to make sure you got good seasonal signal. Failure rate only 0.1{\%}. With fitted global function, 10{\%} and 90{\%} amplitudes are beginning/ending of seasons. Rate of increase/decrease determined by 1st derivative of midpoint of the season. In African application, Gaussians demonstrate better flexibility than Fourier transforms and good seasonal transition extraction. Also, spatially coherent and logical patterns across continent.},

@article{meentemeyer2013,
abstract = {We present a multilevel modeling framework for simulating the emergence of landscape spatial structure in urbanizing regions using a combination of field-based and object-based representations of land change. The FUTure Urban-Regional Environment Simulation (FUTURES) produces regional projections of landscape patterns using coupled submodels that integrate nonstationary drivers of land change: per capita demand, site suitability, and the spatial structure of conversion events. Patches of land change events are simulated as discrete spatial objects using a stochastic region-growing algorithm that aggregates cell-level transitions based on empirical estimation of parameters that control the size, shape, and dispersion of patch growth. At each time step, newly constructed patches reciprocally influence further growth, which agglomerates over time to produce patterns of urban form and landscape fragmentation. Multilevel structure in each submodel allows drivers of land change to vary in space (e.g., by jurisdiction), rather than assuming spatial stationarity across a heterogeneous region. We applied FUTURES to simulate land development dynamics in the rapidly expanding metropolitan region of Charlotte, North Carolina, between 1996 and 2030, and evaluated spatial variation in model outcomes along an urban-rural continuum, including assessments of cell- and patch-based correctness and error. Simulation experiments reveal that changes in per capita land consumption and parameters controlling the distribution of development affect the emergent spatial structure of forests and farmlands with unique and sometimes counterintuitive outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},
